Copied from
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries">guava-libraries</a>
, but only keeping the stuff we actually need.

<p>Rather than having an explicit dependency on guava-libraries, we
repackage just the few classes we need from guava-libraries to better support
low-space environments like Android. Note that some functionality may be removed
from some of the classes to minimize size, so it is not necessarily an exact
copy.</p>

<p><b>Warning: this package is experimental, and its content may be
changed in incompatible ways or possibly entirely removed in a future version of
the library</b></p>

@since 1.0
